Project: LLM-Playground-From-Scratch
Author: Mohammad AlShurbaji
Purpose: Educational project demonstrating the full workflow of building, training, and fine-tuning a small GPT-style LLM from scratch.

Main Components:
1. Downloading and extracting LLM technical report PDFs
2. Cleaning and preprocessing
3. Regex tokenizer implementation + vocabulary creation
4. BPE tokenization using tiktoken
5. Dataset creation using sliding windows
6. PyTorch dataloader
7. GPT2 model training (two versions)
8. Instruction-following dataset generation (2000+ samples)
9. Fine-tuning
10. Evaluation (BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, F1, and model-as-a-judge)

Notes:
- The project is purely educational.
- Many components are adapted from "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)" and rasbt’s repository.
- Models trained here are small and not intended for real deployment.
